# QR Code Migration Guide

This guide covers the recent updates to the bike rental system that introduce proper QR code support and migration from the legacy `hardwareId` field structure.

## Overview

The system has been updated to use `qrCode` as the primary identifier for bikes, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing `hardwareId` field. This change improves mobile app integration and provides better bike identification.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Field Structure
- **New Primary Field**: `qrCode` - The preferred identifier for bikes
- **Legacy Field**: `hardwareId` - Maintained for backward compatibility
- **Requirements**: At least one identifier (qrCode or hardwareId) must be present

### 2. Updated Components

#### BikeQRCode Component (`src/components/BikeQRCode.js`)
- Prioritizes `qrCode` field over `hardwareId` for QR code generation
- Displays warnings when bikes have mismatched identifiers
- Shows clear status indicators for QR code assignment
- Generates QR codes in simple string format for mobile app compatibility

#### BikeDetailsDialog Component (`src/components/BikeDetailsDialog.js`)
- Displays both QR Code and Hardware ID fields
- Shows "Not assigned" when fields are empty
- Improved layout with detailed bike information

#### BikesList Component (`src/components/BikesList.js`)
- Enhanced search functionality to include both `qrCode` and `hardwareId`
- Updated search placeholder to indicate QR code search capability
- Improved filtering logic for comprehensive bike searching

#### AddBike Component (`src/components/AddBike.js`)
- Added QR Code and Hardware ID input fields
- Real-time validation to prevent duplicate identifiers
- Clear indication of preferred identifier (QR Code)
- Form validation ensures at least one identifier is provided

#### EditBike Component (`src/components/EditBike.js`)
- Added QR Code and Hardware ID editing capabilities
- Smart validation that accounts for current bike's identifiers
- Prevents conflicts with other bikes during updates

### 3. New Services

#### Migration Service (`src/services/migrationService.js`)
Provides comprehensive migration and validation functionality:

- `migrateBikesToQRCodeField()` - Migrates existing bikes from hardwareId to qrCode
- `validateBikeQRCodes()` - Validates all bikes for QR code integrity
- `checkQRCodeCollisions()` - Checks for duplicate identifiers
- `generateQRCodeReport()` - Generates detailed status reports

#### QR Code Migration Panel (`src/components/admin/QRCodeMigrationPanel.js`)
Administrative interface for managing the migration:

- Visual status dashboard with bike statistics
- One-click migration functionality
- Detailed issue reporting and recommendations
- Real-time validation results

### 4. Database Indexes

Updated `firestore.indexes.json` to include:
- Optimized indexes for `qrCode` field queries
- Compound indexes for efficient bike searching
- Field overrides for improved query performance

## Migration Process

### Automatic Migration
1. Use the QR Code Migration Panel in the admin dashboard
2. Click "Generate Report" to see current status
3. Click "Migrate Bikes" to automatically copy `hardwareId` to `qrCode` for bikes missing QR codes
4. Monitor the migration results and resolve any conflicts manually

### Manual Migration
For bikes requiring manual intervention:
1. Edit the bike using the updated EditBike form
2. Assign unique QR codes to bikes with conflicts
3. Update any bikes missing both identifiers

## Best Practices

### For New Bikes
- Always assign a unique QR Code as the primary identifier
- Hardware ID is optional and should only be used for legacy compatibility
- Ensure QR codes are unique across the entire system

### For Existing Bikes
- Run the migration tool to automatically populate QR codes
- Review and resolve any duplicate identifier warnings
- Consider updating old hardware IDs to follow QR code conventions

### Mobile App Integration
- QR codes are generated as simple strings for easy scanning
- The mobile app should primarily use the `qrCode` field
- Fall back to `hardwareId` for backward compatibility if needed

## Validation Rules

### QR Code Field
- Must be unique across all bikes
- Cannot conflict with any existing `hardwareId` values
- Preferred identifier for new bikes

### Hardware ID Field
- Must be unique across all bikes
- Cannot conflict with any existing `qrCode` values
- Used for backward compatibility

### Business Rules
- At least one identifier (qrCode or hardwareId) is required
- Both fields can be present but must be unique
- QR codes take precedence for bike identification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Duplicate Identifiers
**Problem**: Multiple bikes have the same QR code or hardware ID
**Solution**: 
1. Use the Migration Panel to identify conflicts
2. Manually edit bikes to assign unique identifiers
3. Re-run validation to confirm resolution

#### Missing Identifiers
**Problem**: Bikes have neither QR code nor hardware ID
**Solution**:
1. Edit each affected bike individually
2. Assign a unique QR code as the primary identifier
3. Optionally add a hardware ID for compatibility

#### Migration Failures
**Problem**: Migration process encounters errors
**Solution**:
1. Check Firebase security rules and permissions
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Review console logs for specific error messages
4. Try migrating bikes individually if batch migration fails

### Database Queries

#### Finding Bikes by QR Code
```javascript
const qrCodeQuery = query(
  collection(db, "bikes"), 
  where("qrCode", "==", qrCodeValue)
);
```

#### Finding Bikes by Either Identifier
```javascript
// Check both fields for comprehensive search
const qrCodeQuery = query(collection(db, "bikes"), where("qrCode", "==", identifier));
const hardwareIdQuery = query(collection(db, "bikes"), where("hardwareId", "==", identifier));
```

## Security Considerations

### Firebase Rules
Ensure your Firestore security rules allow:
- Reading bike documents for QR code validation
- Updating bike documents during migration
- Proper user authentication for admin operations

### QR Code Generation
- QR codes should be generated as simple strings
- Avoid complex JSON structures that might cause scanning issues
- Consider using standardized formats for consistency

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
1. Run the QR Code Report monthly to identify issues
2. Monitor for duplicate identifier creation
3. Validate QR code functionality with mobile app testing

### Performance Optimization
- Ensure database indexes are properly configured
- Monitor query performance for bike lookups
- Consider caching frequently accessed bike data

## Support

For issues or questions regarding the QR code migration:
1. Check the Migration Panel for automated diagnostics
2. Review this guide for common solutions
3. Examine console logs for specific error details
4. Test with a small subset of bikes before bulk operations
